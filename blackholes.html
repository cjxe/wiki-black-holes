	alt="This an image of a black hole.
	It is the first combined image reconstruction
	of the event horizon of a black hole captured by the Event Horizon Telescope
	along with the CHIRP algorithm.">

<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: center;">
	A black hole is a region of spacetime that exhibits gravitational acceleration so strong
	that nothing is able to espace from it (including particles and light).
	The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.
	The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon.
	Even though the event horizon has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it,
	no locally detectable features appear to be observed.
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: center;">
	The gravity of the black hole is so strong becasue matter
	has been squeezed into a tiny space.
	This occurs when a star is dying.
	Becasue light is not able to escape, people are not able to see black holes, as they are invisible.
	Space telescopes have been modified with special tools
	to enable us to see it.

<h3 style="color: black; font-family: Arial; text-align: center;">How big are Black Holes?</h3>

<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: center;">
	Black holes can be big or small.
	Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom.
	These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain.
	Mass is the amount of matter, or "stuff," in an object.
	Another kind of black hole is called "stellar."
	Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun.
	There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy.
	Earth's galaxy is called the Milky Way.
	The largest black holes are called "supermassive."
	These black holes have masses that are more than 1 million suns together.
	Scientists have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center.
	The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius A.
	It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths.
</p>

<h3 style="color: black; font-family: Arial; text-align: center;">How Black Holes are formed</h3>

<p style="font-family: Arial; text-align: center;">
	Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began.
	Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or collapses.
	When this happens, it causes a supernova.
	A supernova is an exploding star that blasts part of the star into space.
	Scientists think supermassive black holes were made at the same time as the galaxy they are in.
